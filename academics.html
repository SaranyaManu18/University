                    <p>The Sunray University has a tradition of giving students
                         a sound foundation in the fundamentals of engineering but today, those fundamentals must be 
                         augmented by experiential learning and soft skills. Developing leadership and entrepreneurship skills, 
                         we ensure our students have internships to improve teamwork and communication skills, giving them real engineering experience. 
                         For those who are entrepreneurially inclined, it provides them the knowledge and resources to turn ideas into startups.</p>
